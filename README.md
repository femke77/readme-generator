# README.md Generator 

## Description ‚úèÔ∏è

This code will prompt the user on the usual readme sections and allow them to generate a readme.md for their project with emojis, TOC and proper formatting. Mulitple screenshots are supported. Screenshots must be located in the /assets/images folder of the project while assuming the README.md will be output or manually moved to the root of the readme's project directory. Output for the README.md is chosen using inquirer-select-directory and can be placed anywhere on the user's machine.

Now with support for adding tech badges. 

This README.md was created using this program, and therefore I have my screenshots in the /assets/images folder.

You can update this generator as you like to make it work better for you! My personal email is listed as the default for the email question and you will change that and make it yours.
